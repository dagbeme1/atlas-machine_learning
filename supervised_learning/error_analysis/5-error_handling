''' When dealing with high bias and high variance,
 it is important to address both issues.
  Training more (A) can help reduce bias by allowing the model 
  to learn more complex patterns. 
  Trying a different architecture (B) or building a deeper network (D) 
  can help reduce variance by increasing the model's 
  capacity to capture complex relationships.

In cases of high bias and low variance, training more (A) 
can help mitigate bias by allowing the model to learn more complex patterns. 
Trying a different architecture (B) and building a deeper network (D) 
can also improve the model's performance by increasing 
its capacity to capture more nuanced relationships.

 When facing low bias and high variance, trying a different architecture (B) 
 can be beneficial to capture more complex relationships. 
 Getting more data (C) can help reduce variance by providing 
 a broader representation of the underlying distribution. 
 Using regularization techniques (E) can also be effective in 
 reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

When both bias and variance are low, 
and the model is performing well, 
there may not be a need for specific actions. 
In this scenario, doing nothing (F) is a reasonable approach
