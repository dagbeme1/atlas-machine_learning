def l2_reg_gradient_descent(Y, weights, cache, alpha, lambtha, L):
    """
    Function that updates the weights and biases of a neural network
    using gradient descent with L2 regularization.

    Arguments:
    - Y: numpy.ndarray of shape (output_size, m) representing the one-hot
         encoded labels for the training examples.
    - weights: dictionary of weights and biases for each layer of the network.
    - cache: dictionary of cached values (outputs of each layer) needed for
             computing the gradients.
    - alpha: learning rate for gradient descent.
    - lambtha: L2 regularization parameter.
    - L: number of layers in the neural network.

    Returns:
    - None (updates the weights in-place).
