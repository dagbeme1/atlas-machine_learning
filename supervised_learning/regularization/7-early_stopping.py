Early Stopping

def early_stopping(cost, opt_cost, threshold, patience, count):
    """
    Determines if gradient descent should be stopped early based on validation cost.

    Arguments:
    - cost: Current validation cost of the neural network.
    - opt_cost: Lowest recorded validation cost of the neural network.
    - threshold: Threshold used for early stopping.
    - patience: Patience count used for early stopping.
    - count: Count of how long the threshold has not been met.

    Returns:
    - Tuple containing a boolean indicating
    whether to stop early and updated count value.
