Time Series Forecasting with LSTM
This project focuses on forecasting cryptocurrency prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The goal is to predict future price movements based on historical data.

Overview
Cryptocurrency prices are known for their volatility, making them an interesting domain for time series forecasting. LSTM networks, with their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, are well-suited for this task.

Bitcoin (BTC) became a trending topic after its price peaked in 2018. Many have sought to predict its value in order to accrue wealth. Letâ€™s attempt to use our knowledge of RNNs to attempt just that.

Given the coinbase and bitstamp datasets, write a script, forecast_btc.py, that creates, trains, and validates a keras model for the forecasting of BTC:

Your model should use the past 24 hours of BTC data to predict the value of BTC at the close of the following hour (approximately how long the average transaction takes):
The datasets are formatted such that every row represents a 60 second time window containing:
The start time of the time window in Unix time
The open price in USD at the start of the time window
The high price in USD within the time window
The low price in USD within the time window
The close price in USD at end of the time window
The amount of BTC transacted in the time window
The amount of Currency (USD) transacted in the time window
The volume-weighted average price in USD for the time window
Your model should use an RNN architecture of your choosing
Your model should use mean-squared error (MSE) as its cost function
You should use a tf.data.Dataset to feed data to your model
Because the dataset is raw, you will need to create a script, preprocess_data.py to preprocess this data. Here are some things to consider:

Are all of the data points useful?
Are all of the data features useful?
Should you rescale the data?
Is the current time window relevant?
How should you save this preprocessed data?

1. Everyone wants to know
mandatory
Everyone wants to know how to make money with BTC! Write a blog post explaining your process in completing the task above:

An introduction to Time Series Forecasting
An explanation of your preprocessing method and why you chose it
An explanation of how you set up your tf.data.Dataset for your model inputs
An explanation of the model architecture that you used
A results section containing the model performance and corresponding graphs
A conclusion of your experience, your thoughts on forecasting BTC, and a link to your github with the relevant code
Your posts should have examples and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on LinkedIn.

When done, please add all URLs below (blog post, shared link, etc.)

Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.

Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Any missing data points are dealt with using imputation or deletion techniques.
Normalization: The data is normalized using Min-Max scaling to ensure uniformity and stability during training.
Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of:

An LSTM layer with 50 units and ReLU activation function to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
A Dense layer with a single unit for predicting the next price value.
Adam optimizer with a mean squared error (MSE) loss function.
Training and Evaluation
The data is split into training and validation sets for model evaluation.
Training is performed for 5 epochs with a batch size of 256.
Model performance is evaluated using loss curves, including training and validation loss.
Results
The trained models achieve competitive performance in forecasting cryptocurrency prices.
Loss curves visualize the training process and highlight any overfitting or underfitting issues.
