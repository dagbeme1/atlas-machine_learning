This is Autoencoders are neural networks designed for unsupervised learning, emphasizing efficient data representation through an encoder and decoder. Latent space captures essential features, constrained by a bottleneck layer for meaningful compression. Sparse autoencoders introduce sparsity constraints for robust feature learning. Convolutional autoencoders leverage convolutional layers for structured data like images. Variational autoencoders, a probabilistic variant, learn a latent space distribution for generative capabilities, with the Kullback-Leibler divergence ensuring a close match to a specified prior distribution.
