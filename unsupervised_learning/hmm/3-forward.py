    Perform the forward algorithm for a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

    Args:
        Observation (numpy.ndarray): 1D array of shape (T,) containing the indices of observations.
        Emission (numpy.ndarray): 2D array of shape (N, M) with emission probabilities.
        Transition (numpy.ndarray): 2D array of shape (N, N) with transition probabilities.
        Initial (numpy.ndarray): 2D array of shape (N, 1) containing the initial state probabilities.
